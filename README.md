# **About Me**

### **My Interests**
***
Below are some of my personal areas of interest and a few details about each one.
- **Exercise** has always been a passion of mine. It is something I am very knowlegeable about, and it is something I have incorporated into my life as both a hobby and a career.
- **Rucking** is a specific form of exercise resembling a military style road march during which participants wear heavy rucksacks (military style backpacks) while traveling a predetermined distance. While a road march traditionally involves walking in formation over a set distance along a road or similar thoroughfare, _rucks_, as they are called, are not limited to roads and can involve traversing any type of terrain.
- **Orienteering** is a competetive form of land navigation. At orienteering events, participants use a handheld map and compass to navigate to a series of checkpoints as fast as possible. At each checkpoint is a uniquely designed hole punch which the competitor uses to mark a sheet of paper in its corresponding field (proving that they were physically at the checkpoint). While beginner level events may make use of trails and other helpful landmarks, orienteering typically involves mostly off-trail navigation through wooded and rugged terrain.
- **Computers** is currently an expanding area of interest for me. I originally became interested in the hardware aspect of computers about 10 years ago in order to play a video game that I was badly addicted to (The game was called Arma 2 back then it is now Arma 3). My interest in hardware components quickly spread to software related things, most notably coding. I began with HTML and CSS and eventually moved on to javascript and some PHP. I found that one thing I really enjoyed was integrating my computer skills into other areas of my life like exercise. I eventually began using javascript to write calculators for complex mathematical equations in order to make them feasible for everyday use by my clients. One example is a calculator I wrote in javascript that determines the number of calories burned during an exercise session. The user inputs some biometric information in addition to the duration of exercise and their average heart rate throughout and converts that data to an actual number of calories burned. Such information is very useful to have in on real-time basis.

### **Websites I Recommend** 
***
- [Exercise calculators and information](www.exrx.net) This is a low-budget looking but very helpful website pertaining to exercise prescription. Its content is geared more toward exercise professionals rather than everyday gym-goers but overall it is a very educational site full of reading material and tools.
- [Fitness in the tactical context](www.soflete.com) This site is all about exercise science in the military/special operations domain. Functional conditioning for extreme and physically demanding environments has never been more widely sought after - and, in my opinion, exercise doesn't get much more interesting than this!
- [Local orienteering information and events](www.backwoodsok.com) Website for the Backwoods Orienteering Klub (they spell it that way). This site includes basic information about orienteering, required items and where to find them, as well as upcoming orienteering events in the Raleigh/Durham area.
- [Arma 3 website](www.arma3.com) This is the official Arma 3 website. It includes information for developers, downloadable content, and much more.
- [My favorite coding resource](www.w3schools.com) This is a link to the W3 Schools website. For anyone unfamiliar, the site contains in depth specifications, syntax guidelines, and information for a variety of programming languages.  I used this site to learn the majority of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- [Customizeable topographic maps](www.usgs.gov) This contains a variety of mapping tools and information for anyone looking for topograhical or other specialized types of maps.
