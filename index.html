    <h1>My name is Kyle Barbehenn</h1>
    <p>I was born in Fairfax, Virginia on May 18th, 1984. Shortly thereafter, my parents moved to Moorestown, New Jersey, where I spent my childhood and teenage years. After completing high school, I moved to Greenville, North Carolina in August of 2003, where I attended East Carolina University. After graduating from ECU with a B.S. in Communications, I eventually moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 2015. While living in Raleigh I met my wife Kelsey, and we eventually moved to Louisburg, North Carolina in 2021 where we currently reside.</p>
